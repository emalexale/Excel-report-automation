Automated Excel report using formulas to reduce manual work and save time

Excel Report Automation
Business Problem
Manual reporting from CSV files was time-consuming, often taking hours to complete. The process involved manually inputting figures across multiple branches and currencies.

Solution
I built an automated Excel report using formulas like VLOOKUP, IF, and SUMIFS to dynamically pull and calculate values. This eliminated manual entry and reduced report generation time from hours to just 5 minutes.

Tools Used
Microsoft Excel

VLOOKUP, IF, SUMIFS, and other formulas

CSV data import and transformation

Outcome
Reduced reporting time from hours to minutes

Improved accuracy and consistency

Enabled faster decision-making for management
